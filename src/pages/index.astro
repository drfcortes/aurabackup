        <p class="text-[#2b361c] mb-4">
            Over the past decade, the rapid development and adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools has transformed how knowledge is produced, shared, and interpreted across academic, professional, and creative domains. While these technologies offer powerful capabilities for automation and augmentation, their widespread use has introduced significant challenges regarding authorship, transparency, and intellectual accountability.
        </p>

        <p class="text-[#2b361c] mb-4">
            The AURA Protocol (Attribution & Usage Reporting for AI) emerges as a response to this critical moment. It proposes a structured, standardized framework to declare, document, and trace AI-assisted contributions in a verifiable and reproducible manner. Rather than viewing AI-generated content as opaque or secondary, AURA encourages its responsible integration by providing open metadata schemas and public identifiers that detail how, when, and to what extent AI was involved.
        </p>

        <p class="text-[#2b361c] mb-4">
            This initiative draws upon real-world experience in academic research, medical imaging, and computational design—fields where reproducibility, provenance, and clarity are essential. It also stems from the ongoing work of educators and investigators concerned with aligning technological advancement with ethical and scientific rigor.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-[#b17036] mt-8 mb-4">Aims of the Protocol:</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside text-[#2b361c] space-y-2">
            <li>Ensure transparent reporting of AI-assisted content in academic, institutional, and public domains.</li>
            <li>Promote reproducibility by generating standardized metadata for each AI-aided contribution.</li>
            <li>Enable traceable attribution through persistent identifiers and optional hashes.</li>
            <li>Establish an open reference format for documentation, citation, and licensing.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="mt-6 text-sm text-[#d4a369] italic">
            AURA is not a certification system or a gatekeeping tool—it is a technical and ethical infrastructure to support transparency and accountability in the age of generative AI.
