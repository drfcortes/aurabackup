        <p class="mb-4">
            The long-term vision of the AURA Protocol is to establish a robust, transparent, and universally accepted standard for documenting the involvement of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in the creation of intellectual content. Just as identifiers like DOI, ORCID, or citation styles such as APA have become fundamental to scholarly communication, we aim for AURA to serve as a reference infrastructure for reporting AI-assisted contributions across all domains of knowledge production.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            At the core of this vision is the creation of a verifiable and openly accessible metadata framework—capable of capturing the scope, nature, and method of AI participation in any given work, whether textual, visual, computational, or multimedia. This protocol seeks not merely to document AI usage, but to enable meaningful attribution, accountability, and reproducibility in environments increasingly shaped by generative models.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            We envision a public database of AURA blocks, indexed and queryable, where each entry provides clear documentation of how AI systems were prompted, deployed, and refined. By introducing optional content hashes and timestamps, this registry could serve as a point of reference in academic publishing, patent submissions, educational projects, and collaborative design workflows.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            The success of this vision relies not only on technical implementation, but also on cultural adoption. We aim to collaborate with institutions, publishers, educators, and developers to promote responsible usage and visibility of AI's role in knowledge creation. AURA is not meant to restrict innovation, but to support a new layer of transparency and scientific rigor as AI becomes deeply embedded in intellectual processes.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">
            This vision stems from hands-on experience in research-intensive contexts, where accurate documentation and reproducibility are not optional—they are foundational. Our goal is to build tools that align with those values and empower users to disclose AI involvement with clarity and integrity.
        </p>

        <h2 class="text-2xl font-semibold text-emerald-400 mt-8 mb-2">What We Hope to Achieve</h2>
        <ul class="list-disc list-inside space-y-2">
            <li>To create a permanent, traceable system for declaring AI-generated content.</li>
            <li>To serve as a technical reference point akin to bibliographic standards.</li>
            <li>To contribute to public trust in AI-assisted research and media production.</li>
            <li>To support interoperability with existing metadata standards and publishing platforms.</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="text-sm mt-6 text-gray-600 italic">
            We believe that transparency is not a constraint—it is a commitment. AURA seeks to make that commitment actionable.
